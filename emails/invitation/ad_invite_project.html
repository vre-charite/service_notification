      <p><b>{{ inviter_name }}({{ inviter_email }}) has invited you to join the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) Portal as a member of their project.  </b></p>
      <p>The VRE platform is designed to make it easier for you to find and securely access data and use it in innovative ways. You can learn more about the VRE <a href="https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/network/digital-medicine/bihcharite-virtual-research-environment">here</a>, or access the user guide <a href="{{ domain }}/xwiki/wiki/vrepublic/view/Main/user_guide/">here</a>.  Instructions for setting up and accessing your account are listed below.  </p>
      <p><b><u>Project Details:</u></b></p>
      <p>Project Name: {{ project_name }}</p>
      <p>Project Code: {{ project_code }}</p>
      <p>Project Role: {{ project_role }}</p>
      <br>
      <p><b><u>Next Steps:</u></b></p>
      <p>As part of the VRE’s  integration with the Charité Health Data Platform, external VRE users who are not employees of the Charité and have not previously been granted access to a Charité system (e.g., email or VPN) are required to submit a request for an account to the Charité Geschäftsbereich IT, before they can be granted access to the VRE and its integrated workbench tools.  </p>
      <p>If you already have a Charité account, please contact your Project Administrator or reach out to {{ support_email }}.</p>
      <p>To submit your request, please complete the steps below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complete the <i>Charité Active Directory Access Request Form</i> attached to this email.
          <ul>
            <li>Complete all fields in the Datum des Antrages section ensuring that the email address entered into the form matches the email address that this email was sent to: {{ user_email }}</li>
            <li>Leave the Antragsgrundlage and Angaben zum Antragsteller sections blank if you do not have this information</li>
            <li>Sign and date the form</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Send the completed and signed form to the VRE administrator at {{ admin_email }} for processing and approval.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once approval is received for your Charité Active Directory account, you will receive a confirmation email from the Charité Geschäftsbereich IT with your account details, which you can then use to log into the VRE Portal at <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>.
      <p>If you have questions about how to fill out the form, please contact your Charité partner for assistance, or send an email to {{ support_email }}.</p>
