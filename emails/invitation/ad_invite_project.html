You can learn more about {{ product_name }} <a href="{{ about_url }}">here</a>, or access the user guide <a href="{{ domain }}/xwiki/wiki/vrepublic/view/Main/user_guide/">here</a>.

      <p><b><u>Next Steps:</u></b></p>
      <p>As part of {{ product_name }}’s integration with the {{ company_name }} Health Data Platform, external {{ product_name }} users who are not employees of the {{ company_name }} and have not previously been granted access to a {{ company_name }} system (e.g., email or VPN) are required to submit a request for an account to the {{ company_name }} {{ department_name }}, before they can be granted access to {{ product_name }} and its integrated workbench tools.  </p>
      <p>If you already have a {{ company_name }} account, please contact your Project Administrator or reach out to {{ support_email }}.</p>
      <p>To submit your request, please complete the steps below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complete the <i>{{ company_name }} Active Directory Access Request Form</i> attached to this email.
          <ul>
            <li>Complete all fields in the Datum des Antrages section ensuring that the email address entered into the form matches the email address that this email was sent to: {{ user_email }}</li>
            <li>Leave the Antragsgrundlage and Angaben zum Antragsteller sections blank if you do not have this information</li>
            <li>Sign and date the form</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Send the completed and signed form to {{ product_name }} administrator at {{ admin_email }} for processing and approval.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once approval is received for your {{ company_name }} Active Directory account, you will receive a confirmation email from the {{ company_name }} {{ department_name }} with your account details, which you can then use to log into {{ product_name }} Portal at <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>.
